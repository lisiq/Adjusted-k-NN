# Adjusted-k-NN
An implementation of the adjusted k-NN algorithm for imbalanced data from the paper "An Adjusted Nearest Neighbor Algorithm Maximizing the F-Measure from Imbalanced Data". 
-  I have also implemented the first experiment form the paper using the Glass dataset, we randomly draw 80%-20% splits of the data to generate the training and test sets respectively.
-  Hyperparamters are tuned with a 10-fold cross-validation over the training set.
- Here you can find the dataset, the python script, and the jupyer notebook of the implemented algorithm.
